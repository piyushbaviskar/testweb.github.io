The temple is dedicated to lord Ganesha with a lotus pond near it. Padmalaya temple is among the ‘two and a half’ Ganpati peeths in India. This temple is revered as a half peeth. The temple has two swayambhu ganesh idols namely Aamod and Pramod. Both these idols consist of corals and one has its trunk curving to the right and other one to the left. Both the idols are swayambhu meaning self-existed. The temple is made of stone with a pond beside it. The pond used to be full of lotus flowers hence the temple is known as Padmalaya. The temple is located at the top of the hills and is surrounded by various small temples. The temple has padukas of Shree Govind Maharaj with a huge bell weighing 440 kgs next to it. Mythology says that that Bhim in his battle with the Bakasura defeated him. To quench his thirst after the fight he hit his elbow on the ground to form a pond of water. This place is called Bhimkund and is located near Padmalaya. Various herbs and medicinal plants are found in the vicinity of the Padmalaya temple. </p>
